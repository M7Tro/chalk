Finally, I am going to make a website without following any tutorial. I start with a high-level idea and try to implement it using knowledge that I have acquired (plus I WILL use documentation, articles and chatgpt: I don't consider that shameful).

I want to make a real-time app that lets people draw on a canvas. I will use Socket.io and React. For the rest, I am still not sure. I will have to make some research and figure out the architecture, necessary parts of the backend, etc. The web app is going to be called Chalk. Like a chalkboard where people can draw and leave it for someone else to add/erase.
